## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### 1. Clear Browser Data
- [ ] Clear localStorage
- [ ] Clear cookies
- [ ] Clear cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)

### 2. Test Registration Flow
- [ ] Navigate to https://app.quankey.xyz

- [ ] Check browser console for token storage message
- [ ] Verify no errors in console

### 3. Test Password Save
- [ ] Generate quantum password
- [ ] Save to Local Vault
- [ ] Verify save completes without 401 error
- [ ] Check network tab - Authorization header present

### 4. Test Quantum Vault
- [ ] Navigate to Quantum Vault tab
- [ ] Initialize vault if needed
- [ ] Add new password entry
- [ ] Verify save completes successfully

## 📊 Success Criteria
- ✅ No 401 errors on password save
- ✅ Token visible in localStorage after login
- ✅ All API calls include Authorization header
- ✅ Both Local and Quantum vault saves work

## 🔍 Troubleshooting
If 401 errors persist:
1. Check backend logs for token generation
2. Verify JWT_SECRET env var is set
3. Check token expiry (currently 30 days)
4. Verify frontend is sending Authorization header

## 📝 Notes
- Backend auth endpoints now return JWT tokens
- Frontend enhanced with better token handling
- Token stored in localStorage with key 'token'
- 30-day token expiry configured
