## 🚀 **PHASE 1: SETUP (30 seconds)**

### **Script Narration**:
*"Let me show you Sarah, a security professional at a defense contractor. She's setting up Quankey for the first time."*

### **Actions on Screen**:

#### **00:00-00:10 - User Registration**
```bash
# Terminal visible
echo "👤 Creating new user: Sarah Kim (security@defense-corp.com)"
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register/begin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"sarah.kim", "displayName":"Sarah Kim - Defense Corp"}'
```

**Screen shows**: User registration with biometric prompt

#### **00:10-00:20 - Biometric Enrollment**
**Screen shows**: Fingerprint sensor animation + "Biometric enrolled successfully"

#### **00:20-00:30 - Recovery Shares Generation**
```bash
echo "🌌 Generating quantum recovery shares..."
# Show 5 recovery shares being created
echo "✅ Share 1: Encrypted and sent to sarah.personal@gmail.com"
echo "✅ Share 2: Stored in corporate HSM"  
echo "✅ Share 3: Printed and secured in vault"
echo "✅ Share 4: Backup on secure USB drive"
echo "✅ Share 5: Distributed to trusted colleague"
```

**Screen shows**: 5 recovery shares with different storage locations

### **Key Passwords Added**:
```bash
# Quickly add 3 critical passwords
echo "🔐 Adding critical passwords..."
echo "  - Corporate VPN: quantum-secured"
echo "  - AWS Production: 256-bit entropy"  
echo "  - Classified Database: ANU-QRNG generated"
```

**Narration**: *"Sarah stores her most critical passwords using true quantum entropy. Notice the instant quantum password generation."*

---

## ⚠️ **PHASE 2: ATTACK SIMULATION (45 seconds)**

### **Script Narration**:
*"Two weeks later, Sarah's laptop is compromised. Watch how Quankey detects and responds to this threat in real-time."*

### **Actions on Screen**:

#### **00:30-00:40 - Device Compromise Simulation**
```bash
echo "🚨 SECURITY ALERT: Suspicious login detected"
echo "Device: Sarah's MacBook Pro"
echo "Location: Unknown (VPN masked)"
echo "Biometric: FAILED - Multiple attempts"
echo "Behavior: Unusual access patterns detected"
```

**Screen shows**: 
- Real-time security dashboard with red alerts
- Map showing suspicious location
- Failed biometric attempts counter

#### **00:40-00:55 - Threat Intelligence**
```bash
echo "🔍 THREAT ANALYSIS:"
echo "  - Malware detected: Keylogger variant"
echo "  - Network scan: Attempting password vault access"
echo "  - Encryption status: SECURE - Zero-knowledge maintained"
echo "  - Data exposure: NONE - Vault remains sealed"
```

**Screen shows**:
- Real-time threat detection dashboard
- Network activity graph showing malicious attempts
- "VAULT SECURE" green indicator

#### **00:55-01:15 - Automatic Protections**
```bash
echo "🛡️ AUTOMATIC RESPONSE INITIATED:"
echo "  - Device access: REVOKED"
echo "  - Session tokens: INVALIDATED"  
echo "  - Biometric data: QUARANTINED"
echo "  - Recovery mode: ACTIVATED"
```

**Screen shows**: Automated security response in action

**Narration**: *"Notice that even with a fully compromised device, the attacker gains zero access to passwords. Our zero-knowledge architecture means even we can't see Sarah's data."*

---

## 🔄 **PHASE 3: QUANTUM RECOVERY (60 seconds)**

### **Script Narration**:
*"Now watch the magic - Sarah recovers her entire vault in under 90 seconds using quantum-secured recovery shares. No other password manager can do this."*

### **Actions on Screen**:

#### **01:15-01:30 - Recovery Initiation**
```bash
echo "📧 Recovery email sent to sarah.personal@gmail.com"
echo "🔗 Recovery link: https://recovery.quankey.xyz/emergency"
echo "📱 SMS backup code sent: ***-***-1337"
```

**Screen shows**: Recovery initiation from new device (different browser/computer)

#### **01:30-01:50 - Share Collection**
```bash
echo "🔑 COLLECTING RECOVERY SHARES:"
echo "Share 1/5: ✅ Email share retrieved"
echo "Share 2/5: ✅ HSM share validated"  
echo "Share 3/5: ✅ Physical share entered"
echo ""
echo "🧮 SHAMIR'S SECRET SHARING:"
echo "Threshold: 3/5 shares (60% consensus)"
echo "Quantum reconstruction: IN PROGRESS..."
echo "Master secret: RECONSTRUCTING..."
```

**Screen shows**:
- Progress bar for each share
- Mathematical visualization of Shamir's Secret Sharing
- Quantum reconstruction animation

#### **01:50-02:05 - Instant Vault Recovery**
```bash
echo "🌌 QUANTUM VAULT RECOVERY:"
echo "✅ Master key reconstructed from quantum entropy"
echo "✅ AES-256-GCM vault decryption successful"
echo "✅ All passwords recovered: 247 entries"
echo "✅ Biometric re-enrollment ready"
echo ""
echo "⚡ RECOVERY TIME: 87 seconds"
echo "📊 DATA LOSS: 0 bytes"
echo "🔒 SECURITY LEVEL: MAINTAINED"
```

**Screen shows**: 
- Vault contents fully restored
- All passwords visible and accessible
- New biometric enrollment prompt

#### **02:05-02:15 - New Device Enrollment**
```bash
echo "👆 RE-ENROLLING BIOMETRIC ON NEW DEVICE..."
echo "✅ New fingerprint captured"
echo "✅ Device registered and secured"
echo "✅ Old device permanently revoked"
echo "✅ Full access restored"
```

**Screen shows**: Quick biometric enrollment on new device

**Narration**: *"And just like that, Sarah is back to full productivity. Her compromised device is permanently locked out, but she loses zero data and zero access."*
