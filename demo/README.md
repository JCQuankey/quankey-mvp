🚨 Alert: Suspicious login detected
🔍 Analysis: Malware & keylogger identified
🛡️ Response: Automatic device revocation
📊 Status: Zero passwords exposed
```

### **Phase 3: Quantum Recovery (60 seconds)**
```bash
# Recovery from new device
📧 Recovery: Email + SMS verification
🔑 Shares: 3/5 shares collected (60% threshold)
🧮 Reconstruction: Shamir's Secret Sharing
⚡ Result: Full vault restored in 87 seconds
```

### **Phase 4: Final Metrics**
```bash
# Performance dashboard
⏱️ Recovery Time: 87 seconds
📊 Data Loss: 0 bytes
🔒 Security: 0 breaches
🆚 Competitors: 1000x faster recovery
```
